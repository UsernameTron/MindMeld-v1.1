# Comprehensive Codebase Management Strategy - Implementation Tracker

## Overview
Use this tracker to monitor the implementation of the guidelines and processes outlined in the Comprehensive Codebase Management Strategy document.

---

## 1. Code Organization Principles
- [ ] **1.1 Directory Structure**
    - [ ] Implement defined top-level directory structure (`src/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `config/`, `data/`, `deploy/`)
- [ ] **1.2 Development Tools Management**
    - [ ] Relocate `analyze_codebase.py` (and similar tools) to `scripts/`
    - [ ] Ensure development tools are version controlled but excluded from deployment artifacts
    - [ ] Create/Update `README.md` in `scripts/` for tool usage instructions

---

## 2. Development Workflow
- [ ] **2.1 Branching Strategy**
    - [ ] Define and adopt `main` and `develop` as primary branches
    - [ ] Implement supporting branch conventions (`feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`)
- [ ] **2.2 Code Review Process**
    - [ ] Enforce reviews for commits to `develop` and `main`
    - [ ] Integrate automated checks (linting, tests) as pre-review requirements
    - [ ] Implement pull request templates with checklists
    - [ ] Establish SLAs for review turnaround (if applicable)

---

## 3. Deployment Strategy
- [ ] **3.1 Artifact Management**
    - [ ] Define and implement rules for production artifacts (excluding dev tools, tests)
    - [ ] Create/Update `.dockerignore` or equivalent exclusion rules
    - [ ] Configure CI/CD for separate build definitions (app deployment, dev env, test execution)
- [ ] **3.2 Environment Configuration**
    - [ ] Implement environment-specific configuration loading
    - [ ] Standardize use of environment variables for runtime configuration
    - [ ] Implement secure secrets management (separate from code)
    - [ ] Support local overrides for development

---

## 4. Quality Assurance Processes
- [ ] **4.1 Automated Testing**
    - [ ] Implement/Enhance unit test layer
    - [ ] Implement/Enhance integration test layer
    - [ ] Implement/Enhance system test layer
    - [ ] Implement/Enhance performance test layer
    - [ ] Configure test execution in CI/CD (pre-merge, nightly, release candidate)
- [ ] **4.2 Code Analysis Integration**
    - [ ] Integrate `analyze_codebase.py` (or similar) for static analysis, architectural validation, etc.
    - [ ] Schedule regular analysis runs in development cycle/CI
    - [ ] Define process for tracking analysis metrics over time

---

## 5. Documentation Guidelines
- [ ] **5.1 Code Documentation**
    - [ ] Enforce docstring requirements for public modules, classes, methods, functions
    - [ ] Standardize documentation of input/output behavior and exceptions
    - [ ] Promote use of type hints
- [ ] **5.2 Project Documentation**
    - [ ] Create/Update comprehensive `README.md` at project root
    - [ ] Create/Update developer onboarding documentation
    - [ ] Document system architecture and key design decisions
    - [ ] Create/Update troubleshooting guides
- [ ] **5.3 Tool Documentation**
    - [ ] For each script in `scripts/` (including `analyze_codebase.py`):
        - [ ] Document purpose and usage
        - [ ] List dependencies and prerequisites
        - [ ] Explain output formats
        - [ ] Provide example commands

---

## 6. Collaboration Practices
- [ ] **6.1 Knowledge Sharing**
    - [ ] Establish regular code walkthroughs (if applicable)
    - [ ] Implement pair programming practices (if applicable)
    - [ ] Set up/Maintain a development wiki or shared documentation space
- [ ] **6.2 Onboarding Process**
    - [ ] Develop/Refine step-by-step onboarding guides
    - [ ] Ensure sandbox environment availability for new developers
    - [ ] Implement mentorship program (if applicable)
    - [ ] Create starter tasks for new team members

---

## 7. Tooling Recommendations
- [ ] **7.1 Development Environment**
    - [ ] Standardize IDE configurations (e.g., via `.editorconfig`, shared settings)
    - [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks (formatting, validation)
    - [ ] Provide containerized development environment options (if applicable)
- [ ] **7.2 Code Analysis Tools**
    - [ ] Integrate standard static analysis tools (pylint, flake8, mypy, etc.)
    - [ ] Integrate security scanning tools (bandit, safety, npm audit, etc.)
    - [ ] Standardize dependency management tools (pip-tools, poetry, npm, etc.)

---

## 8. Implementation Roadmap
- [ ] **8.1 Phase 1: Reorganization (2 weeks)**
    - [ ] Restructure directories (as per Section 1.1)
    - [ ] Move utility scripts to `scripts/`
    - [ ] Update all import paths and references affected by reorganization
    - [ ] Create initial documentation for new structure and tool locations
- [ ] **8.2 Phase 2: Workflow Enhancement (3 weeks)**
    - [ ] Fully implement and enforce branching strategy (Section 2.1)
    - [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline with test and analysis stages (Appendix A.2)
    - [ ] Set up automated testing framework and initial test suites (Section 4.1)
    - [ ] Integrate code analysis tools into CI/CD (Section 4.2)
- [ ] **8.3 Phase 3: Documentation and Training (2 weeks)**
    - [ ] Complete documentation for all components and processes (Section 5)
    - [ ] Conduct team training on new processes and tools
    - [ ] Finalize onboarding materials (Section 6.2)
    - [ ] Gather initial feedback on new strategy and make adjustments

---

## 9. Path Specific Configurations (for `analyze_codebase.py`)
- [ ] **`analyze_codebase.py` Configuration**
    - [ ] Implement `argparse` for configurable `--output-dir` and `--vector-storage` paths
    - [ ] Update script's docstring with new usage instructions
    - [ ] Ensure `os.makedirs` uses the parsed arguments for directory creation

---

## 10. Continuous Improvement

- [ ] **10.2 Feedback Loops**
    - [ ] Schedule regular retrospectives on development processes
    - [ ] Establish a system for collecting developer experience feedback
    - [ ] Implement a process for tracking and addressing common pain points

---

## Appendix A: Tool Configuration Templates
- [ ] **A.1 `.dockerignore` Example**
    - [ ] Create/Update `.dockerignore` file to exclude development tools, tests, analysis outputs, docs, dev configs, and VCS files.
