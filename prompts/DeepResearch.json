  "description": "A robust prompt template designed for rigorous, evidence-based research queries. It ensures the AI performs retrieval of credible sources, cross-verifies information, and produces well-cited answers. The template emphasizes structured investigation with tools, fact-checking, and high-quality references to support every claim.",

  "enhancement_tips": [
    "Explicitly set a recency cutoff or time horizon in the constraints (e.g., focus on studies from the last 5 years) to ensure up-to-date information when relevant.",
    "Define a clear citation format (APA, MLA, etc.) and enforce consistency so that the output is ready for publication or scrutiny.",
    "If the query involves quantitative data, use the Python tool to run quick calculations or statistical checks on retrieved data for validation.",
    "Incorporate an evidence scoring step: have the AI rate confidence or relevance of each source and prefer higher-scoring evidence in the synthesis.",
    "Apply an adversarial fact-check pass where the AI attempts to refute its own answer using the available sources, to catch unsupported claims before finalizing the response."
  ],
  "output_format": "Markdown with properly formatted citations (e.g., APA style with source URLs and dates). The answer should be structured, often with sections like Introduction, Findings (with bullet points or sub-sections per evidence point), and a Conclusion. A bibliography or list of sources should be included at the end. The final output should also contain a confidence score or statement about the strength of evidence, and flag any areas of uncertainty.",

    "output": "*(The assistant first performs searches using the 'web' tool and retrieves several recent high-quality studies and a Cochrane review. It then uses chain-of-thought reasoning referencing those sources.)* **Answer:** Long-term e-cigarette use among young adults has been associated with several adverse health outcomes. Evidence suggests increased risks of respiratory issues, including a decline in lung function and higher incidence of chronic bronchitis symptoms【1】. Some longitudinal studies indicate potential cardiovascular risks, such as higher blood pressure and arterial stiffness in consistent e-cigarette users over several years【2】. There is also emerging evidence of an increased likelihood of transitioning to traditional cigarette smoking, as noted in a 5-year cohort study【3】. However, data on certain outcomes like cancer risk are still inconclusive given e-cigarettes’ relatively recent rise in popularity【4】. The evidence is mixed regarding whether e-cigarettes are less harmful than traditional cigarettes in the long run; while they eliminate tar, they still deliver nicotine and other chemicals whose long-term effects are not fully understood【1】【5】. **Confidence:** Given the current body of evidence (including systematic reviews and multiple cohort studies), confidence in these findings is moderate. More long-term studies are needed for high-confidence conclusions, especially regarding outcomes like cancer that manifest over decades. **Sources:** [1] Smith et al. (2023) – Systematic review of respiratory outcomes in e-cigarette users; [2] Lee & Gupta (2022) – Longitudinal study on cardiovascular health in vaping vs non-vaping young adults; [3] Patel et al. (2021) – Cohort study on gateway effect of e-cigarettes; [4] Government Health Agency Report (2024) on e-cigarette usage statistics; [5] Johnson (2020) – RCT comparing short-term effects of e-cigs vs cigarettes."
