  "title": "Counterfactual Analysis Prompt",
  "description": "A structured prompt template for exploring counterfactual scenarios by altering a key event or condition and analyzing the causal effects in detail. It guides the AI through defining the factual baseline, making a specific minimal change, and reasoning through the consequences while enforcing domain constraints and plausibility.",

    "actual_baseline": "String. The actual event or current state that really occurred (one concise sentence).",
    "counterfactual_change": "String. The precise alteration to reality to explore (a minimal rewrite of the baseline).",
    "scope_window": "String. Time frame or logical span for examining effects (e.g., 'T0 to T0+5 years' or 'entire project lifecycle').",
    "domain_constraints": "String or list. Key physical, legal, or logical constraints that remain in force in the counterfactual scenario (e.g., laws of physics, specific policies, budget limits).",
    "data_sources": "Optional. List of strings or descriptions. Relevant datasets, documents, or expert inputs available to inform the analysis (for grounding with evidence)."

    "Implausible outcomes that violate stated domain constraints (e.g., physics-defying effects or policy breaches ignored).",
    "Omission of significant downstream or second-order effects triggered by the counterfactual change.",

  "enhancement_tips": [
    "Use explicit constraint filters to discard outcome branches that break fundamental rules or given constraints, ensuring realism.",
    "Integrate optional advanced reasoning (like Bayesian updates or sensitivity analysis) if probabilistic data or historical analogies are available, to refine the outcome estimates.",
    "Map out the causal chain thoroughly: identify immediate effects of the change, then recursively follow how those effects lead to further consequences (consider feedback loops and delays).",
    "Include multiple metrics or perspectives for comparison (economic, social, environmental, etc.) to provide a well-rounded outcome analysis, if applicable.",
    "Perform a self-check: verify each causal step is justified and identify any vague leaps in logic; if found, either clarify or acknowledge them as uncertainties."

  "output_format": "Flexible. Options include a narrative prose walkthrough of the scenario, a decision_tree (ASCII or diagram) illustrating branching outcomes, a matrix comparing key metrics (Actual vs Counterfactual with deltas and confidence), or a timeline of events. The output should conclude with: (1) a list of assumptions and any citations used, (2) at least three caveats addressing the plausibility and uncertainties of the scenario, and (3) suggestions for further research or analysis.",

        "City traffic reports 2015-2025",
        "Research studies on similar traffic policies in other cities"
      ]
    },
    "output": "Narrative: **Baseline:** The city’s traffic policy, introduced in 2020, successfully cut congestion by about 30% in the following years by optimizing signal timings and promoting public transit. **Counterfactual Scenario:** If the city **had not implemented** the policy, congestion would have likely continued to worsen. **Chain-of-Thought Analysis:** Immediately from 2020 onward, traffic volumes during peak hours would remain high without signal optimization. Minor accidents and delays might grow by a small percentage each year due to increasing congestion. **Tree-of-Thought:** Several plausible branches emerge: (a) drivers adapt by finding alternate routes (spreading congestion to side streets), (b) more people turn to public transit out of frustration (if available), or (c) business hours shift city-wide to off-peak times to cope. **Constraint Filters:** We discard any branch assuming infinite road capacity or teleportation (physical impossibilities). **Outcome Comparison:** *Average Commute Time* – **Actual:** 40 minutes post-policy, **Counterfactual:** 55 minutes by 2025 (Δ +15m); *Carbon Emissions* – **Actual:** 5% reduction, **Counterfactual:** likely a 5% increase (Δ +10% relative). We remain moderately confident, as these estimates rely on linear traffic growth models. **Assumptions & Citations:** Assumes no other traffic interventions【source: CityTrafficReport2021】, and similar patterns as seen in other cities without such policies【source: Smith2020Study】. **Caveats:** (1) **Behavioral adaptation** – commuters might change habits in unpredictable ways. (2) **Economic factors** – e.g., fuel prices could independently reduce traffic. (3) **Model uncertainty** – the exact congestion increase could vary. **Next-Step Research:** Examine real cases of cities that failed to implement planned traffic policies to validate these projections."
