# Components Structure

- All UI components are grouped under `src/components/`.
- Use subfolders for feature-specific components (e.g., `src/components/Analyze/`).
- Shared UI primitives go in `src/components/ui/`.
- Each component should have a co-located test file (`ComponentName.test.tsx`).
- Document props and usage in a README or JSDoc in each component folder.
