# Phase 5: Security Testing & OpenAI Integrations

## Security Testing Plan
- E2E tests for:
  - Logout flow (single and multi-tab)
  - Session timeout/expiry
  - Invalid/expired token handling
  - Cookie security flags (HttpOnly, Secure)
  - Error scenarios (network, server, auth failures)
- Manual and automated penetration testing
- Review of all auth/session flows for edge cases

## OpenAI Integration Plan
- Add service layer for OpenAI API (DI pattern)
- Unit and E2E tests for OpenAI-powered features
- Security review of prompt injection, data leakage, and API key handling
- Document integration architecture and test approach

## Architecture Docs
- All new service modules must use DI factory pattern
- All OpenAI and security logic must be fully testable and mockable
- See `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for service/test patterns

Draft and update this plan as Phase 5 progresses.
