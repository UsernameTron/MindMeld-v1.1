  "tests": "To create Python unit tests using PyTest (assuming `src` is a directory containing the source code you wish to test), follow these steps:\n\n1. Ensure that your project structure has an `__init__.py` file in it, which makes 'src' a package and allows for relative imports within modules of this package if needed. Here\u2019s how it might look like with some dummy module (assuming we have two files `module_one.py` & `module_two.py`).\n\n```bash/src\nproject-root/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 module_one.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 module_two.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 test/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_module_one.py\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_module_two.py\n```\n  \n2. Within `test/` directory, create two new files: one for each function or class you want to unit-test in your source code modules (`src/`). Here's how the structure could look like after creating tests correspondingly (assuming we have simple functions and a small test case):\n\n```python\n# src/module_one.py contents assumed as:\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n  \n\nimport unittest\nfrom . import module_one\n\nclass TestModuleOne(unittest.TestCase):\n  def test_addition(self):\n      self.assertEqual(module_one.add(10,2), 12)\n      \nif __name__ == 'main':    # This condition will only run when this file is executed directly as a script (not from pytest).\n   unittest.main()         # PyTest replaces the need for main method in test files and uses fixtures instead of `setUp()` & tearDown()`. Here we remove it, because tests should be independent.   \n```    \nRepeat similar structure with modifications inside your other module (`module_two`). \n\n3. To run these PyTest unit tests, use the following command in terminal:  \n`pytest test/`. This assumes you have pytest installed; if not install it using pip as follows : `pipenv shell`, then type and execute `:syn load --list plugins | grep 'pytest'` to ensure that they are properly loaded. Afterwards run with a simple `-v` flag for verbose output: \n```bash/src  \n(base) $ pytest -v test/\n...    \n------------------------------- no tests ran in 0.12 seconds ]\ncollected 4 items                               PASSED        : 4         Failed          : 0           Errors       : 0            Skipped      : 0\n```   \nRemember, pytest has many additional features and fixtures which are not utilized in the example above. When writing your unit tests consider these too for a more robust testing setup such as: mock objects (with `unittest.mock` or third-party libraries like `pytest-mock`), parameterizing test cases using `@pytest.mark`, reporting results, etc., with PyTest'n its rich set of plugins and fixtures to simplify your tests even further!\n  \nNote also that in Python 3+ the way `__main__` works has changed slightly: if you wanted something more complex involving this old style (without test suite), a different approach is needed. Here, however, we\u2019re assuming all of these files are intended for testing purposes only as per your request structure provided above.\n  \nI hope that helps! Please let me know how else I can assist with the setup or understanding PyTest in general \u2013 happy coding/testing!",
