# Temporary Minimal GitHub Workflows (May 2025)

All GitHub Actions workflows have been replaced with minimal placeholder versions to eliminate errors and simplify CI/CD. These workflows only:
- Install dependencies
- Run basic build and test commands
- Use a placeholder deploy step (no real deployment)

All artifact, release, and complex script logic has been removed. This is a temporary measure until robust workflows can be reintroduced.

**Restore full workflows when the codebase and requirements are stable.**
