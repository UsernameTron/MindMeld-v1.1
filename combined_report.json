      "tests": "To create Python unit tests using `pytest` in a project located at \"src/\", you should follow these steps:\n\n1. Ensure your package structure is set up correctly, with an `__init__.py` file inside the 'src/' directory so that it can be recognized as part of the package namespace by pytest when run from outside this folder (i.ish). Here's how a typical project layout should look:\n\n```plaintextothere/project_folder/:\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py    # Make sure to include an empty file here for Python 2 support compatibility if needed; optional in newer versions of Python as modules are automatically discoverable without it.\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 src/          # Here all your source files reside\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 module1.py   # Your actual codebase with functions, classes etc. that you want to test\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py  # To make the 'src' folder a Python package for pytest discovery (not needed if using just one file/module).\n    ...             # Additional modules as your project grows\n```\n\n2. Write some basic tests: Assuming there is an example function `add` in module1.py, you could write corresponding unit test like this within the same folder or a separate 'tests/' directory nested inside src/:\n\n```python3\n# If using Python 2 style imports (not recommended):\nfrom ..module1 import add      # Importing from parent package dir when relative to source code of module under testing. Not needed in recent versions with absolute paths and glob patterns for test discovery, but kept here per your request:\nimport pytest             # No need if you're using Python 3 where this is standard library already available; import statement above takes care of that requirement as well. This line should be enough to get started without additional imports needed in modern environments or when just writing tests for one module, respectively!\n\ndef test_add():           # The name convention 'test_*' allows pytest automatically discovering these functions and running them whenever you execute `pytest`.\n    assert add(2, 3) == 5   # Simple assertion to check the expected output of your function. Here we assume that \"module1\" has a defined function called \u201cadd\u201d which takes two arguments. If it doesn\u2019t exist or does something different like summing differently: make sure tests are updated accordingly!\n```\n\n3. Run pytest from outside src/ directory (assuming Python 3): You can invoke the test runner directly within your project's root folder, without needing to navigate into 'src/' itself because of absolute imports by default in modern versions of python:\n\n```shell\npytest path_to_your_project/tests/                      # Here we specify that pytest should find tests relative from this location. Adjust the `path_to_your_project` as appropriate for your system and where you place these files within your project structure (not 'src/' itself). \n```\n\nPytest will automatically detect all functions prefixed with \"test_\" in any test modules it finds here, such as a dedicated folder or inline tests. Each time pytest is run from the command line while at this location (`path_to_your_project/`), these `assert` statements within your defined 'tests/' directory would trigger and verify that each function behaves exactly how expected when given specific input values like in our example above for a simple add() test.\n\nRemember, you don't need to import `__init__.py` files explicitly if writing tests with pytest or using Python 3 since it follows absolute imports by default (so `from src.module1 import some_function`). If your project is large enough and functions are spread across multiple modules within the 'src/' directory, you can also use glob patterns to discover these test cases more efficiently:\n```shell\npytest path/to/*                 # This would run all tests in any files ending with '_test.py' or similar naming convention under src/, making it even easier as your project grows! \n```\nThe above command will match and trigger the discovered functions (with 'test_'). Keeping these principles at hand, you can set up comprehensive testing for complex projects using `pytest`.",

      "tests": "To generate PyTest unit tests, we first need to have a Python project structure. Based on your request `src/` seems like it contains the source code of our application that needs testing. Let's assume this directory has some modules and functions which interact with each other (e.g., you might be using Flask for web service). Here is how we can set up PyTest tests:\n\n1. First, ensure pytest-bdd package is installed if it isn\u2019t already to support BDD testing style via Gherkin language in Python files within the `features/` folder (optional):\n```shell\npip install pytest-bdd\n# For Flask applications or similar projects you could also use: flask_testing as below.\npip install flask_testing \n```\n2. Next, create a test file inside your project structure under tests directory. Let\u2019s name it `test_source.py`. Here's how we can write some simple PyTest functions to start with (assuming Flask application):\n```python\n# File: src/tests/test_source.py  # or another location of your preference within the project structure where tests are located  \nimport pytest\nfrom app import create_app, db    # Assumed that you have an `app` module in 'src/' which is created via Flask's factory method and has a database connection object for testing. \n\n@pytest.fixture()\ndef test_client(app):  \n     return app.test_client()                       \n```\n3. Here are some simple tests to cover basic CRUD operations: (Assuming you have models in `models/`)\n ```python\nfrom src import create_app, db    # Assumed that your source code has a function named 'create_app' which returns an instance of Flask application and initializes the database. \n from flask_testing import TestCase        # Imported as part of test suite for testing web applications  \n     class BasicTests(TestCase):                      \n          def setUp(self):            \n              self.client = app.test_client()          \n              with app.app_context():    # Assumed that you have a way to setup the application context in your source code, as Flask's test client uses this when making requests  \n                  db.create_all()               \n          def tearDown(self):              \n             db.session.remove()            # Assuming use of SQLAlch0me or similar database ORM with session for transaction management    \n             \n         def test_index_get(self):   \n             rv = self.client.get('/')  # Assumed the root endpoint returns a list  \n# Here, `assert` is used to validate HTTP response and content returned by your Flask application's view function/method for index route in this case. It can be adjusted according to requirements of each test (like specific expected data)    \n             assert b\"Welcome!\" in rv.data    # Adjust as per what you expect at the root URL  \n             \n         def test_index_post(self):      \n            payload = { 'name': \"Test\", } \n# The following are some simple tests for creating and deleting records, adjusted based on your application specifics. You might have forms or different ways to create/delete data:    \n             rv = self.client.post('/', data=payload)   # Assumed you add new item at index route here   \n# Here too as above with HTTP response and content validation according to what we expect when adding a record through POST request     \n            assert b\"Item added!\" in rv.data \n            \n         def test_item_delete(self):   # Assumed that you have an item ID provided for delete operation   \n              payload = { 'id':1}                          \n# Similarly, testing deleting of a record:    \n            rv = self.client.post('/remove/'+str(payload['id']), data=None) \n             assert b\"Item deleted!\" in rv.data   # Adjust according to what you expect when removing an item through DELETE request   \n                               \n```     \n4. To run these tests, simply use your terminal and navigate into the root directory of your project (where `test_source.py` is located), then type: \n ```shell    \n python -m pytest   # This will discover all files within 'tests/' that start with test_, execute them sequentially by default as it finds, collects their results and finally prints the detailed summary of tests execution alongwith any failure cases or errors encountered.   \n```     \nRemember these are very basic PyTest unit testing examples which can be greatly expanded upon according to specific needs/complexities your source code has (more complex data relationships among models etc.). For more sophisticated scenarios, consider using fixtures for initializing test databases and factories or other tools like `unittest.mock` along with these tests where appropriate.\n  \nNote: The above examples assume that you are working on a Flask application but the same principle can be extended to any Python web framework out there as long as PyTest is installed, and your source code files (functions/methods) follow proper standards of documentation for testing purposes e.g., docstrings explaining purpose, input arguments etc; which forms part of good coding practices in general too.",

Ensure your test files are structured correctly within the source code directory (e.g., following a naming convention like `_tests`) or as individual `.py` modules with tests inside them. \n3. Create PyTest functions that assert expected results for each function in `src/`. Here's an example of how you might write such test cases:\n\nAssuming the source code contains several Python files under a directory named \"src\":\n\n```python\n# src/my_module.py (example module)\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n    \n def subtract(a,b):\n   if not isinstance(a, int) or not isinstance(b,int):  # A simple type check for demonstration purposes only.\n      raise ValueError(\"Both arguments must be integers.\")\n        \n   result = a - b\n    return result\n```\nNow let's write the corresponding tests in `test_my_module.py`:\n\n```python\n# test/test_my_module.py (example testing module)\nimport pytest\nfrom src import my_module  # Import your actual source modules here, if they are named differently or located elsewhere within 'src/' hierarchy.\n\ndef test_add():\n    assert my_module.add(3,4) == 7\n    \ndef test_subtract_with_positive_numbers():  \n    # Here we're testing for positive numbers only because the function raises an exception with negative inputs as per your source code snippet provided above:\n    assert my_module.subtract(10,5) == 5\n    \ndef test_subtract_raising_exception():  \n    # This will fail due to incorrect type of input (non-integer):\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n        my_module.subtract('a', 'b')\n```\nRemember, the above tests are very simple and intended for demonstration purposes only; real test cases should be more robust against various types of incorrect inputs as well as testing all functionalities of your actual source code functions/classes etc. \n\nTo execute these PyTest unit tests simply run `pytest` in command line:\n```shell script\n$ pytest test_my_module.py\n```\nThis assumes you have a correct directory structure and the necessary imports for each function being tested, as well as your source code correctly residing within an accessible \"src/\" folder relative to where this testing module is located (from command line). \n\nFor more complex cases with fixtures or other advanced features of PyTest, refer to [Pytest's official documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).",

Follow these steps:\n\nStep 1 - Installing pytest if not already installed (Run this command outside of your Python environment):\n```shell\npip install pytest\n```\n\nStep 2 - Write test cases inside 'tests/test_modulex.py' where `modulex` is the name of a module in src folder:\nHere, we assume that there are two functions called function1 and function2 within your source code which take some parameters and return specific outputs for given inputs based on certain conditions. Here\u2019s how you can write test cases around these examples with pytest using `assert` statement to verify the functionality of those methods in Python:\n```python\n# tests/test_modulex.py\nimport sys\nfrom src import module1  # assuming your source code is under 'src' folder and has a file called module1.py\n\ndef test_function1():\n    assert function1(2,3) == expected output here   # replace with correct parameters and the result you expect from those inputs for function1() in src/modulex.py\n    \ndef test_function2(): \n    assert function2('input string') == expected output here #(replace 'input string' & actual outcome as per your implementation)\n```        \nNow, run these tests using PyTest: Go back to the root directory of your project (where `src/` and `__init__.py` are located), then in terminal or command prompt type this line for running all test cases present inside '/tests/' folder :  \nFor Unix/Linux systems:   \n```shell \npytest tests/\n```    \nOr on Windows system using Command Prompt(cmd):      \n```cmd         \npython -m pytest tests/\n```        \nThese will discover and execute all the written test cases. The output displays which specific case failed if there are any, along with its details for debugging purposes. \nNote: Make sure your source code functions under `module1` in 'src/' directory have return statements or proper outputs to be tested against by PyTest assertions above; otherwise pytest will throw an error due lack of testable results from the function calls within these tests, as described here for Python'dictor.\n    \nFor more complex testing scenarios involving fixtures (shared setup code), parametrized tests etc., you can refer to official documentation [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). Also if your source files use specific decorators or functions, like `mock`, `@patch` for dependencies mocking, make sure they are properly imported in the test script as well since PyTest uses them too during testing phase and to check out more about how fixtures work refer this [Pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/_modules/pytest/fixture).\n    \nRemember, pytest is case sensitive so ensure your file names follow the correct casing i.e., 'tests/' folder with '.py' extensions for test scripts and '_init_.__pt__.py', as they should be in Python project structure under root directory where `src/` present alongwith `__init__.py`.\n    \nHope this helps!
