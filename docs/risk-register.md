## Mitigation Details

### R01: Insecure Auth Token Storage (MITIGATED)

**Previous Implementation:**
- Access tokens stored in sessionStorage
- User data stored in localStorage
- Vulnerable to XSS attacks

**Current Implementation:**
- HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, Secure cookies for refresh tokens
- Access tokens stored in memory only (not accessible via JavaScript)
- Automatic refresh token flow for silent authentication renewal
- Added token validation and proper error handling

**Validation:**
- E2E tests verify the entire authentication flow
- Security tests for token tampering resistance
- Proper cookie attributes verified in response headers

### R04: CORS Policy Violations (MITIGATED)

**Previous Implementation:**
- Direct browser calls to LibreChat API (different origin)
- No CORS headers configured
- Frontend errors due to Same-Origin Policy violations

**Current Implementation:**
- Implemented Next.js API routes as reverse proxy
- All external API calls routed through /api/proxy/[service]/[...path]
- Backend handles all cross-origin requests
- Added proper error handling and request forwarding

**Validation:**
- E2E tests verify proxy functionality
- CORS errors eliminated from browser console
- External API responses properly proxied to frontend

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Impact / Likelihood | Low | Medium | High |
|--------------------|-----|--------|------|
| **Critical** | | R05 | |
| **High** | | | R01 ✓, R04 ✓ |
| **Medium** | R03 | R02, R06 | |
| **Low** | | | |

## Next Steps

1. Address remaining open risks, prioritizing:
   - R05: Hardcoded JWT Secret (Critical impact)
   - R02: Missing CSRF Protection (Medium impact)

2. Add security scanning to CI pipeline:
   - Static application security testing (SAST)
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Secret scanning

3. Schedule regular security reviews and updates to this register
