# Strategic Full-Stack System Review

**Date:** May 11, 2025  
**Reviewer:**  
**Codebase Version:**  
**Context:** Comprehensive system audit for stability, scalability, and architectural alignment.

---

## 1. System Architecture Map

### 1.1 Frontend Architecture
- Design system and component hierarchy:
- SSR/client boundaries:
- Context/state usage:
- API integration (OpenAPI):
- **Security posture:**
- **Performance metrics:**
- **DevOps/CI integration:**

### 1.2 Backend Architecture
- Routing and service decomposition:
- Middleware and DI:
- Auth/token lifecycle:
- Data models and validation:
- **Security & compliance:**
- **Performance & scaling:**
- **Deployment/observability:**

### 1.3 Frontâ€“Back Integration
- OpenAPI contract enforcement:
- Typed boundary quality:
- Request/response flow and latency risks:
- Testing and coverage across the boundary:
- **Dependency health:**
- **Historical context:**

---

## 2. Granular Observations and Findings

Group by layer (UI, API client, backend, etc.)

**Example:**
- `src/components/Button.tsx`: Missing ARIA label on dynamic variant
- `app/services/auth.py`: Circular import workaround in refresh flow

For each finding, include:
- File path, line number, summary, category (UI, API, Service, Auth, SSR, Performance, Security, DevOps)
- First identified, status history, owner (if assigned)

---

## 3. Strategic Risk Register

| Risk ID | Title | Impact | Location | Root Cause | Mitigation Plan | First Identified | Owner | Status History | Addresses Action(s) |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|------------|------------------|------------------|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| R01     | LocalStorage token storage | High | frontend/src/services/auth.ts | Insecure session persistence | Move to HttpOnly cookie-based refresh token flow | 2025-05-11 |  | Identified | A01 |
| R02     | OpenAPI spec untyped | Medium | backend/app/openapi.py | No type generator integrated | Auto-generate types during CI | 2025-05-11 |  | Identified | A02 |

---

## 4. Systemic Misalignments

- Design token system partially implemented but not applied across components
- SSR disabled for CodeEditor, but Monaco still adds ~400KB to bundle
- Auth is client-only while SSR pages expect protected data
- **DevOps:** CI pipeline does not enforce lint/type/test gates
- **Security:** No formal vulnerability assessment or compliance tracking
- **Historical:** No changelog or delta since last review

---

## 5. Engineering Action Plan

### 5.1 Foundational Fixes
- [ ] Implement refresh token auth flow (auth service + frontend) <span id="A01"></span>
- [ ] Add OpenAPI type generation + enforce in CI <span id="A02"></span>
- [ ] Fix module resolution config (tsconfig + imports)
- [ ] Assign owners and target completion dates for each action

### 5.2 Structural Improvements
- [ ] Normalize layout + component boundaries for App Router
- [ ] Replace classnames with clsx globally
- [ ] Modularize backend routers
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and error tracking

### 5.3 Delivery Multipliers
- [ ] Integrate Storybook visual diff testing
- [ ] Add response caching layer to analysis route
- [ ] Introduce common test data generator
- [ ] Add automated dependency health checks
