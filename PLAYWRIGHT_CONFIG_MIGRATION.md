# Playwright Configuration Migration Report

## Summary

The Playwright test configuration has been successfully relocated to the project root level, resolving runtime conflicts and standardizing the test execution structure.

## Changes Made

1. **Configuration Consolidation**
   - Removed: `frontend/playwright.config.ts`
   - Updated: Root-level `playwright.config.ts` with standardized settings
   - Fixed: Configuration to properly use reporters and testing parameters

2. **Test Directory Structure**
   - Confirmed: Tests properly located in `e2e/playwright/` directory
   - Fixed: Accessibility testing library integration with AxeBuilder
   - Ensured: All test files correctly reference the right paths

3. **Next.js Configuration**
   - Updated: `next.config.mjs` to remove experimental AppDir settings
   - Fixed: Configuration warnings during test execution

## Test Results

```
Running 8 tests using 1 worker

✓ 1 Authentication Flow - login → dashboard → token refresh → protected route
✓ 2 homepage is accessible
✓ 3 logout clears session and redirects to login
✓ 4 session timeout redirects to login
✓ 5 logout in one tab logs out other tabs
✓ 6 invalid token redirects to login
✓ 7 blocks access to protected route when not authenticated
✓ 8 sets HttpOnly and Secure flags on auth cookies

8 passed (8.5s)
```

## Benefits

1. **Unified Configuration**: All Playwright settings are now in a single location at the project root
2. **Improved Discovery**: Tests are correctly discovered and executed from the standard location
3. **Consistent Reports**: HTML reports are generated and accessible via `npx playwright show-report`
4. **Clean Exit Codes**: Tests now run to completion with proper exit codes (0 for pass)

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider adding a more comprehensive accessibility testing strategy
2. Add Playwright tests to CI pipeline for continuous validation
3. Extend test coverage to include more UI components and edge cases

## Validation

The migration has been successful, with all 8 tests passing. The configuration is now properly set up at the project root level, and all tests are executing correctly from the `e2e/playwright` directory.
